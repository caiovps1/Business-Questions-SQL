# Business-Questions-SQL

In this guided project, we're going to practice using our SQL skills to answer business questions.
We'll use the Chinook database, which contains data from a fictional music store., and we will try to answer 
plausible questions that could be asked to the data analysis team.

Below, we can see the schema of the database.
